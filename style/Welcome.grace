var message := "Hi! Welcome to the Grace Web Editor!"

//Getting Started:
//     1. Use the buttons on the top of the sidebar to create new files and folders.

//     2. You can also upload your files using the "Upload" button, and can download
//        any currently open file using the "Download" button.

//     3. Any open file can be compiled and run using the "Run" button at the bottom.
//        Try this now by running this file! It will compile and run the code below:

          print (message)
          print "These two lines were printed by the code under #3"

//     4. You might have noticed there is no save button. This is because your code
//        is automatically saved as you type! So you don't need to worry about saving
//        when you're working.

//     5. The sidebar and output area (bottom bar) can be collapsed using the arrow buttons
//        if you need more space.

//     6. You can adjust many editor settings, including it's appearance, in the "Settings"
//        menu, located at the bottom of the sidebar.

//     7. The "Refactor" menu, also located at the bottom of the sidebar, provides some
//        tools that will work with the currently open file.
